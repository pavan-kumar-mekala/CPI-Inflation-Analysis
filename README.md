# CPI-Based Inflation Analysis

An in-depth analysis of Consumer Price Index (CPI) and food inflation trends in India (2018–2023), focusing on COVID-19 disruptions and correlations with global crude oil prices.

## Overview
This project explores CPI dynamics across multiple categories and time periods, identifying trends, key contributors, and correlations with external factors like crude oil prices. The analysis is entirely done in Excel.

## Objectives
- Identify top-contributing categories to CPI.  
- Track inflation trends from 2018 to 2023.  
- Analyze month-on-month food inflation.  
- Assess COVID-19 impact on key CPI categories.  
- Explore correlations between CPI and global crude oil prices.

## Data
- **CPI.xlsx** – Contains category-level and sub-category CPI data from 2018–2023.  
- Data was cleaned and prepared using **moving average imputation** to handle missing values.

## Key Findings
- **Top-Contributing Category (May 2023):**  
  - Food and Beverages had the highest contribution.  
  - Within Food, Spices showed the sharpest rise—indicating price shocks or supply issues.  
  - Transport and Fuel contributed the least.  

- **Inflation Trends (2018–2023):**  
  - Stable inflation in 2018–2019.  
  - Spike in 2020 due to early COVID-19 disruptions.  
  - Peak in 2022 driven by global supply chain issues and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  

- **Month-on-Month Food Inflation (June 2022 – May 2023):**  
  - June 2022: Highest spike (eggs & vegetables).  
  - July–August: Sharp drop (meat, fish, oil).  
  - Oct–Dec: Continued decline, mainly vegetables and oils.  
  - Feb 2023: Largest drop (10% decline in egg prices).  
  - Mar–May: Gradual increase led by fruits and vegetables.  

- **COVID-19 Impact:**  
  - Food inflation high due to supply chain bottlenecks.  
  - Healthcare inflation surged in 2021.  
  - Essential services prices rose post-lockdown as demand normalized.  

- **CPI–Crude Oil Correlation:**  
  - Positive: Pulses, housing, cereals, spices.  
  - Negative: Fruits, oils & fats, meat & fish (likely due to localized supply chains).

## Tools & Techniques
- **Excel:** Data cleaning, transformation, visualization, statistical analysis.  
- **Moving Average Imputation:** To handle missing time-series values.  
- **Visuals:** Line charts, bar graphs, and correlation plots.

## Conclusion
This case study reveals how inflation dynamics vary across categories and time, influenced by external shocks like COVID-19 and global crude oil volatility. The insights are valuable for economic forecasting, strategic planning, and policy formulation.
